"Where shadows once dwelled, embers now burn bright with the resilience of a thousand midnights."

This phrase aims to capture the idea of finding strength and growth in the darkness, rather than trying to outrun it. It suggests that even in the most challenging times, there is always a spark within us that can be fanned into a flame of resilience and determination.
